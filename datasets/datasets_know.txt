PBMC, Mouse ES, Human kidney and Adam datasets were used in cell clustering analysis, Deng and Petropoulos datasets were used in cell trajectory analysis.
20k_PBMC_3p_HT_nextgem_Chromium_X_filtered_feature_bc_matrix.h5 was used for time and memory evaluation.
simul_dataset_generate.R : generate simulated dataset.
simulated_data : simulated datasets for gene expression recovery. 
sample_time_data.py : generate datasets with different cell numbers used for time and memory evaluation. Before the time and memory evaluation, must run this sample_time_data.py to generate datasets.
